- 👋 Hello there, Octet here.
- 😍 I’m love game development. Game development is what got me into software development in the first place when I was a wee little brat.
- 💼 I’m currently working full time as a software engineer, been in the industry for about 20 years. Mostly working on Rust these days, non game development related things.
- 🦄 I’m spending my free time developing a *secret project* along with a few modules for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) that are essential to make that happen.
