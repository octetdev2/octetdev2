# Hello there, Octet here 👋
- 😍 I'm just someome who loves game development. It's what got me into software development in the first place when I was a wee little brat a few decades ago.
- 💼 I’m currently working full time as a software engineer, been in the industry for about 20 years. I am mostly working on Rust these days, interesting things but non game development related things.
- 🦄 I’m spending my free time developing a *secret project* along with a few modules and changes for [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) that are essential to make that happen.

**These are the [Godot Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals) I'm currently focusing on:**
- [Support hexagonal grids with GridMap #4337](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/4337)
